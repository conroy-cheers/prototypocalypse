description: What a sad, empty website... What shall we fill it with?

This is a first post.

Website built with [Deno Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev),
which I'm finding quite pleasant to use.

I've never been great at making up fun names, so I got ChatGPT to generate
a big pile of them and picked out "Prototypocalypse". It's unique, probably related
to what I'm going to write about here, and completely unpronounceable 🙃

Each blog post is generated from a Markdown file, making it simple to add 
new posts. Maybe I could sync them to Obsidian or something.

The template could use some work - styling is a bit too basic and not quite
up to my standards.

Would also be nice to be able to include interactive islands from the md files,
as there's currently no way to do this.

Coming up soon: actually deploying this thing so more than zero people
can read it. I don't think there's a need for any backend; it can all be
served as a static site... may end up throwing it onto the pile of self-hosted stuff,
or using GitHub Pages or something similarly boring.
